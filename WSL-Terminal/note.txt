# The JSON file in directory WSL-Terminal is for just as it would sound like
# the Terminal.  While shutting down the Terminal session running under
# WSL environments would exit with a non-zero exit code (for example '121'
# was the exit-code in Debian Terminal shutdown) This is the return status
# for running the code on all bash sessions as well for other distributions
# installed and running under WSL2.
